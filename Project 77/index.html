        <p>At its heart, Visual Studio Code features a lightning fast source code
            editor, perfect for day-to-day use. With support for hundreds of languages, VS Code helps you be
            instantly productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation,
            box-selection, snippets, and more. 
            Another major perk of Visual Studio Code is that it is supported on macOS, Windows, 
            and Linux. This means that you can take your workspace settings to many platforms without 
            much of a fuss. Visual Studio Code also runs faster than most 
            code and text editors. </p>
